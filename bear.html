            <h4>Spring Hunts</h4>
            <p>Come hunt trophy color-phased black bear on the 2.3 million acre Crow Reservation in Montana. Hunts
                are conducted from May through the end of June in order to capture both rut periods. Hunts are 5 days
                1x1 or 7 days (2x1) and are action packed spot and stalk hunts. Nowhere else in North America will you
                see as many bears, see as many trophy color-phased bears, and have a better opportunity at a
                legitimate 7ft bear as on the Crow Reservation in May and June. This hunt is my favorite all-time hunt.
                The record for the most bears seen in one day is 55 and the most from one vantage point is 14. 60% of
                the bears are color-phased bears and can be spotted in the following eight different phases…black,
                chocolate, brown, calico, red, cinnamon, blonde and white blond. This hunt targets trophy alpha boars
                that will square between 6.5 and 7.5 feet. Success on this hunt is typically 100% with multiple shot
                opportunities. Success on 7ft bears, depending on the year, will typically be greater than 50% for the
                entire season and 65% to 75% from May 22nd to June 30 th . The average trophy bear will have a skull of
                19.5 with a few breaking 20 inches each season. While extremely rare bears have been taken that
                squared over 8ft and topped out with 22-inch skulls on the Crow.</p>
            <p>The hunt includes lodging, guaranteed licenses and guide. Clients provide their own meals on this hunt
                and are responsible for all coolers, ice and game bags. The lodge can accommodate up to 6 hunters and
                is fully stocked with all kitchen ware, bedding and towels. The outfitter recommends a flat shooting
                rifle
                with bipods as all the shooting is done from the prone or sitting position. Hunters should use heavy for
                caliber bullets preferrable 7mm or larger and these monster bears can soak up led and go for a long
                time. Typical shots range from 250 to 500 yards, but you may shoot as far as your equipment/skill allow
                you. This is an outstanding youth hunt opportunity as there is no age requirement on kids and they just
                need a valid hunter safety card on their possession in order to hunt.</p>
            <p>Most asked question is what time frame I should book the hunt for…if you are more concerned with
                hide quality and wouldn't pass up a 6ft blond bear but still want a great chance at a 7ft bear then book
                during the first 3 weeks of May. If you are in big bear mode and have no desire to shoot a smaller bear
                regardless of color, then book during last week of May through last week of June. The success rate on
                the biggest bears is the highest during this time.</p>
            <h4>Fall Hunts</h4>
            <p>Only a limited number of fall bear hunts are offered from mid to the end of September and can be
                combined with bison, antelope, turkey and upland birds. Great hunt for a full, long, perfect hide on a
                trophy 6.3 to 7ft bear. During this time bears are active on fall berry patches from 400pm till dark
                allowing the rest of the day to pursue other species.</p>
