                <p class="aboutpar">&emsp;&emsp;I am a small, customer focused, booking agent that specializes in
                    bringing you hunts
                    that are a cut
                    above
                    the rest. I focus on quality not quantity. Unlike larger booking agents, I have turned down a
                    lot of
                    outfitters over the years that want me to book hunts for them. I only sell hunts with outfitters
                    I have
                    developed a personal relationship with that I deem are a cut above the rest and provide unique
                    or
                    outstanding trophies. I serve as a business advisor with those outfitters, providing feedback
                    from clients
                    and offering sound advice when solicited. My motto is... I won't book a hunt unless I've hunted it
                    myself.
                    My hunt prices are not inflated and are the same price if you call the outfitter and ask. Why
                    not just call
                    the outfitter directly you ask... what do you provide that's different or to my advantage you say.
                    That's
                    an easy one... I monitor my outfitters year-round through the numerous clients I send them
                    throughout
                    the year, year after year. I'm an independent 3rd party that has your best interest in mind and
                    I'm small
                    enough to be able to spend the time monitoring my outfitters. If there's a problem, I know it
                    immediately and work with the outfitter to correct it. Limiting the hunts I sell also gives me
                    the ability to
                    fully interact with my clients, answering questions and making sure you are prepared for the
                    hunt. I
                    take calls, texts and emails. As a bonus for my clients, I provide free consulting services on
                    where to
                    draw premium tags in Montana, Utah and Wyoming, especially for DIY hunts.</p>
